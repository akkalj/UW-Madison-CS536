# Type Checker for the Abstruct Syntax Tree

Yidong Fang

In this project, we implemented the type checker for the parsed AST. The type 
checker will determine the type of every expression represented in the 
abstract-syntax tree and will use that information to identify type errors. 

## Assumptions


## How to build and test

The test input is in the `test.cflat` and `typeErrors.cflat`. The unparsed 
result is in the `test.out` and `typeErrors.out`.

```shell
# build
make
# test
make test
```
